                <p>Mondstadt (German: Mondstadt "Moon City") is one of the seven regions in Teyvat, and the first in
                    which the Traveler starts to look for their lost sibling. It is the city-state that worships
                    Barbatos, the Anemo Archon. Ever since the beginning, Mondstadt has celebrated a festival called the
                    Ludi Harpastum every year, with 15 days of games for the children to enjoy. Before completing Archon

                    Galesong Hill, and Windwail Highland are accessible.</p>

                <h1>Inazuma</h1>
                <p>Inazuma (Japanese: 稲妻 Inazuma) is one of the seven regions in Teyvat. It is an archipelagic region
                    that worships the Raiden Shogun, the Electro Archon, who is also the leader of its governing body,
                    the Inazuma Shogunate. Inazuma is located approximately 4 km southeast from Liyue Harbor and is a
                    close neighbor with the Dark Sea. In the past year relative to the current events of the game, the
                    situation in Inazuma has made a drastic turn towards isolationism, locked down under the Sakoku
                    Decree. "Baal" also enacted the related Vision Hunt Decree, declaring that Visions, as gifts from
                    the gods, should be in the sole hands of divinity — and is now rounding up all Visions in Inazuma to
                    inlay them in the hands of a statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God.Atsuko, an Inazuman who
                    defected to Liyue, describes the country as having a "tense" and "dangerous" environment and
                    discourages traveling there; she also remarks that the Kanjobugyo, one of the Tri-Commission,
                    conduct many assessments that citizens must pass in order to be given permission to leave Inazuma.
                    She bypassed those assessments by making her own raft and fleeing to Liyue. However, the Fatui seem
                    to be able to freely enter and exit due to their diplomatic immunity.
